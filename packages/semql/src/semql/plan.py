"""Typed output models for the four prompt roles.

Each role in the SemQL prompt pipeline emits a structured value:

- ``RouterDecision`` — semantic-vs-raw plus which cubes / views the
  question maps to. Consumed by the Query Generator.
- ``QueryPlan`` — one or more ``QueryStep``s, each tagged with an
  ``intent`` (headline / breakdown / compare / context) so the
  Presenter knows what role each result plays. CompiledQuery into SQL.
- ``Presentation`` — the user-facing narrative + highlights + caveats
  that goes back to the asker. Pairs with ``VizDecision`` (from
  ``semql.visualize``) which separately picks the chart shape.
- ``DrilldownSuggestion`` / ``DrilldownSuggestions`` — proposals for
  "what to ask next" given a row of interest. Each suggestion is a
  ``SemanticQuery`` ready to run, plus a user-facing label.

These types are pure Pydantic and have no LLM dependency. Pair them
with whatever model client you like (pydantic-ai, anthropic SDK, raw
HTTP) — the structured output is the contract.

    would read first. ``highlights`` and ``caveats`` are optional
    bullet lists for "what's interesting" and "what to be careful
    about" (small-sample warnings, missing data, etc.).

    ``chart`` is the optional chart shape from
    :func:`semql.visualize.decide_visualization`. The Presenter
    narrates results; the visualiser picks the chart. ``chart`` is
    ``None`` on text-only surfaces (chat, email) so a chat renderer
    never has to fabricate a chart. On a chart-capable surface the
    caller runs ``decide_visualization`` after compile and sets the
    field; on a text-only surface the caller leaves it ``None`` and
    the prose carries the load. The two surfaces stay decoupled at
    the data level even though the value type is one.

    Kept as ``VizDecision | None`` (not a different Pydantic model)
    so the contract stays small and so a single ``Presentation`` can
    carry both — a chat-with-chart-link UI surfaces the summary plus
    a "see chart" affordance backed by the same value. See
    ``docs/specs/lookup-enrichment-critique-2026-06.md:288-294`` for
